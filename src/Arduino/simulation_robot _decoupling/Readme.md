This directory include 5 projects. Each projects includes a makefile, an example main function and source files. 
Use command "make" to compile the project and generate executable file.

-decoupling: decoupling algorithm generated by Simulink and an using example 
-robot: modeling of a tank type mobile robot generated by Simulink and an using example 
-trajectoryï¼šgiven 2 position to generate a linear tragectory
-simu_robo_decoupling: connect decoupling to the robot to test the decoupling algorithm and to tune PID parametres 
-simu_trajectory: based on simu_robot_decoupling, add a generated trajectory to test the whole control system.
